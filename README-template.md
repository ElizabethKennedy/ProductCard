## My process
I very carefully and closely followed the sagacious instruction of my teacher, Ben Bryant, from TrueCoders.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Layout grids, flexbox properties, padding properties, margin properties, text-transform properties, border-radius properties, style elements.

### Continued development
This project solidified my understanding of Semantic HTML, reinforced my love for all things CSS, and deepened my appreciation for the many wonderful ways one can use CSS to style up a page with flair and panache!
